# The Story

* Just this year, California went through yet another tragedy causing billions of dollars in damages, loss of homes, loss of life, and displaced families.

* Every year, in this side of the coast, for as long as I can remember, this tragedy occurs on repeat!

* I see and hear about emergency responders, responding to these situations and more often times then many, "time" is NOT on our side.

* I see and hear about what happens "after the fact". And that is troubling.

* The imagery that I see being captured in media depicts what literally looks like "hell on earth".

* As an engineer, I need to put my empathy aside for a moment, because I desire a logical solution to combat this problem, however tragedies in the wake of disaster tend not to make the most sense, especially when you're in the thick of things. So let's take a step back ...

* I'm interested in finding out how to increase "situational awareness", because:
  * The sooner you obtain awareness, then the sooner you can respond
  * The sooner you can respond , Then the more options you have on the table
  * The more options you have, then the better opportunity you have to make life saving decisions

* Let's face it, a spreading fire left unchecked, waits for no body.

* So, How do we go about changing parameters to increase awareness?
  * We have the necessary maps and GIS and Spacial data to determine where these events happen. We usually get this data after the fact. But...
  * WHAT IF we could get this data in realtime?
  * WHAT IF we could improve our timing of realization and awareness?
  * WHAT IF we could:
    * get a glimpse of what spatial data looked like in the infrared, in real time, and report to us:
      * Areas in trouble
      * Rate of spread
      * Homes effected
      * Homes at risk
      * And calculate a logical risk priority order of where to put fires out, because let's face it, human beings themselves are slow at calculating risk.
  * COULD you imagine, what we could do with just that as it is happening?

* "Man often becomes what he believes himself to be. If I keep on saying to myself that I cannot do a certain thing, it is that I may end by really becoming incapable of doing it. On the contrary, If I have the belief that I can do it, I shall surely acquire the capacity to do it, even if I may not have it at the beginning"

* Gahndi said this. I think he said this because he made these particular observations, made sense of it, believed in it, and stated it.

* You know, technologically, we're not that far away from achieving this kind of awareness and decision making. It's not impossible.
